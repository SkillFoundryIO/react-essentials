# Exercise: Enhanced Weather Cards
In this exercise, you will improve the Weather Cards example from the previous lesson to load and display cards dynamically using a JavaScript array of objects and the map() function.
## Starter Files
Use the example code from `examples\weather-cards` as the starting point. We have also provided the sample data file in the `exercises\weather-cards-2\start\sampleData.js` file.
## Instructions
To complete this exercise, perform the following tasks:
1. Add the sampleData.js file to the src\ folder of the project.
2. Import the `weatherData` array into the `App.jsx` component. It is a default export, so do not use curly braces!
3. Replace the hard-coded `<Weather />` components with a map from the `weatherData` import.

## Expected Output

When complete, your React app should display the weather data from the sample data file. This isn't all of the data, and the columns will be dynamic based on your screen size:
